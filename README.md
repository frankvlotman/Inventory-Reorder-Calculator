# Inventory-Reorder-Calculator
This Python app, built with Tkinter, helps users calculate reorder quantities for inventory management.
Users input monthly sales, current stock, orders in progress, lead time, and target stock.
The app then calculates and displays the total sales, average sales, reorder quantity, and the number of months the reorder quantity will last.
